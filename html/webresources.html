<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3 Schools</a><br />
W3 Schools is an educational website focused on web development. It covers topics ranging from basic HTML to advanced Javascript, SQL, and AI. Each section of the website is dedicated to one language or topic and contains individual pages for every element of that language or topic. These pages are listed in order of difficulty. For example, the HTML section starts with basic head and body tags, and ends with more complex APIs.<br />
W3 Schools is mostly a reference for syntax and does not deeply explain any concepts or best practices. It is most helpful when learning a new language in addition to other resources. However, it should not be the only reference used, as sometimes pages can list deprecated features.<br />

<a href="https://web.dev/">web.dev</a><br />
web.dev was created by the developers of Google Chrome to teach best practices in web development. It teaches HTML, CSS, and Javascript with a focus on performance and accessibility. Full courses explain the concepts behind each language in detail and track your progress with quizzes. Articles and blogs discuss the latest changes in web development.<br />
web.dev is excellent for understanding the concepts behind web development, not just the syntax. The site is very detailed and teaches best practices for performance and accessibility from the beginning.<br />

<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a><br />
When you encounter a problem while programming and put your error in a search engine, the first result will probably be Stack Overflow. It is a massive question and answer resource for all things programming. Users can post and answer questions, then vote on which answers are best. Best answers are shown above other answers. This saves time for future users searching for the same information.<br />
Stack Overflow is a huge resource with millions of answered questions and one of the best ways to get unstuck in a project.<br />

<a href="https://devdocs.io/">Dev Docs</a><br />
Dev Docs is a list of documentation for many web development topics. The list can be customized and easily searched. Topics and sub-topics are sorted alphabetically and covered in detail.<br />
Dev Docs contains a lot of information, but it is not organized or ordered by difficulty. It is not particularly beginner friendly. Some pages return a 404 error.<br />
